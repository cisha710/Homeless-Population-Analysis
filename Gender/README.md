Project Title: A decadal survey on the impact of various factors on homelessness in the USA (2010-2020)

Team Members: Alexandra Turner, Arle Alcid, Beauty Simora, Isha Chaware, & Nancy Ulloa

Project Description/Outline: Homelessness is a complex and pressing issue that affects millions of individuals and families in the United States. To better understand the evolving nature of homelessness and formulate effective policies and strategies, a comprehensive decadal survey is proposed to examine the impact of various factors on homelessness in the USA from 2010 to 2020. This survey will provide crucial insights into the causes and dynamics of homelessness, enabling policymakers, researchers, and service providers to develop evidence-based interventions and policies.

Research Questions to Answer: 
1.	To what extent does the presence of welfare programs correlate with reduced rates of homelessness?
2.	How are natural disasters impacting homelessness?
3.	What are the demographic characteristics of the homeless population?
4.	How does substance abuse affect homelessness?
5.	What is count of veterans experiencing homelessness?


Rough Breakdown of Tasks: 
1.	Find, clean, & combine datasets.
2.	Each team member is tasked with answering and collecting data for one question:
   
  •	Are some race groups affected by homelessness more than others?

  •	What is the coorelation between gender and homelessness?
  
  •	Does the homeless distribution vary according to age group?
  
  •	What is the count of veterans expierencing homelessness?
  
  •	What is the overall total homeless population taking advantage of CoC shelters available in the area?
  
4.	Analyze and create graphs to answer our research questions.
5.	Clean-up & merge code to GitHub.
6.	Prepare 10-minute presentation.





CLEANING MY DATA

For my specific task, I took the data-frame 2007 - 2020 Point-in-Time Estimates by State - [
](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/xls/2007-2020-PIT-Estimates-by-state.xlsx) and filtered tabs 2020-2015 by state using only CA and TX. I then created a new excel workbook named demo_state_homeless2.xlsx with only the gender columns I needed and cleaned it up to make it very easy to read. I only wanted overall homeless for male, female, and transgender. Sheltered total homeless for male, female, and transgender, and unsheltered homeless for male, female and transgender. 

MAKING GRAPHS/ANALYSIS

I then began my code and made sure everything was clean, and made my graphs - 6 total - comparing the respective categories I chose. I laid out each graph for both CA and TX so I then could analyze and get a brief explanation of the differences and similarities.
