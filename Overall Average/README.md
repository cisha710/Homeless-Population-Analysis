Project Title: A decadal survey on the impact of various factors on homelessness in the USA (2010-2020)
Overall Average Homelessness  
Submitting my code for analyzing and visualizing homelessness data for the years 2013-2020 in Texas (TX) and California (CA). The analysis assesses trends in sheltered, unsheltered, and total homeless populations for both states and provides insights into their respective situations.
Steps Taken:
Data loading and cleaning
Data filtering and merging
Calculation of average homeless populations
Creation of Data Frames for Texas and California
Data visualization using Matplotlib
Combined analysis of both states
Graphs
The code generates line graphs to visualize the data, providing a visual representation of the trends in both states.
Findings:
The analysis shows that California has experienced a significant increase in homelessness, particularly in unsheltered populations, while Texas has seen a slight decrease in total homelessness.
The combined analysis highlights the contrasting situations in the two states, with California facing a more severe homelessness crisis.
